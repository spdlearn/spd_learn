# SPD Learn

> SPD Learn is a pure PyTorch library for geometric deep learning on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. It provides differentiable Riemannian operations, broadcast-compatible layers, and reference implementations of published neural network architectures (SPDNet, TSMNet, EEGSPDNet, TensorCSPNet, PhaseSPDNet, GREEN) for SPD-valued data such as EEG and fMRI covariance matrices.

Key notes for LLMs:
- Prefer the "API Reference" for exact function signatures, layer parameters, and model constructors.
- Prefer "Tutorials" for end-to-end workflows (installation through training).
- The library follows a functional-first design: `spd_learn.functional` (pure functions) -> `spd_learn.modules` (layers) -> `spd_learn.models` (architectures).
- Requires Python 3.11+ and PyTorch 2.0+.
- Licensed under BSD-3-Clause.
